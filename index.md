# Welcome!

Hello, I am Dr. Roger Castells-Graells.

I am a bioengineer with over 10 years of research experience. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the lab of [Prof. Todd Yeates](https://yeateslab.mbi.ucla.edu) at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). I received my undergraduate degree in Bioengineering from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (Spain) in 2015, and earned a PhD in Biochemistry from the John Innes Centre (UK) in 2019 under the mentorship of [Prof. George Lomonossoff](https://www.jic.ac.uk/people/george-lomonosoff/).

Research in the lab is focused on discovering the fundamental principles of macromolecular structure and dynamics.  We are interested in defining conformational states that are essential for function and understanding how conformational transitions couple to biological mechanisms.

We are located in Boyer Hall at UCLA.
